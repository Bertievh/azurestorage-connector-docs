# Operation

The connector can be used by entering arguments on the command line or using the job sub-type.

## AzureStorage Job Sub-Type
The AzureStorage connector provides a Job Sub-Type that can be used to simplify job definitions within OpCon.

When using the Job Sub-Type, fill in the Account name and the Access Key associated with the Storage Account. The key value is the Connection String value that can be found in the Access keys section of the storage account (encrypted global property should be used to store the access key).

Select the Task from the drop-down list and enter the required values. Only values associated with the task will be enabled. Once a task has been saved, the task type cannot be changed.
When uploading or downloading files and specific source and target filenames are entered, wild cards are not supported.

When using the List commands a value must be specified and an (*) will display all containers and and all.
